### Async TCP Library for ESP32 Arduino

This is a fully asynchronous TCP library, aimed at enabling trouble-free, multi-connection network environment for Espressif's ESP32 MCUs.

This library is a base for [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer)

It's a forked version of the original ESP32 [AsyncTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP) library with missing AsyncTCPBuffer class added to make it API-compatible with ESP8266 [ESPAsyncTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP) library

## Installing Async TCP Library

1. Download the latest master source code as a [.zip](https://github.com/gerald-guiony/AsyncTCP/archive/master.zip) file
2. In the Arduino IDE, import the `.zip` file by navigating to **Sketch → Include Library → Add .ZIP Library**
